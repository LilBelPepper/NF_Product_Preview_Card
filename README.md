### What I learned

I'm starting to get a little bored or at least disinterested in the Responsive Web Development Course from freeCodeCamp, so I've decided to take a little bit of a break from those exercises and go out
and try my hand at projects that don't hold my hand as much. I find that I learn a bit better this way as opposed to being spoon-fed instructions that just go "do this, then this, and then this." While
freeCodeCamp is great at getting me started so I know the terms and elements and attributes, sometimes it gets a little long-winded and I'm left bored. 

Frontend Mentor exercises give me just enough freedom and problem-solving to flex my brain muscles and see if I've *actually* learned and retained anything from freeCodeCamp. I enjoy the "puzzle" aspect
these projects; matching everything up to the example after hours of work is very satisfying.  

My current focus items for my code right now are trying to match up element spacing by eye, and gasp a better understanding of flexbox. I *feel* like I understand flexbox, but other times I feel like I'm 
mashing code together and seeing if it works. (If it doesn't work, throw in a div element!) I'm also trying to get a better understanding of code hierarchy still. I find myself making small mistakes,
like wondering where to put the background color for the full page. I initially put the cream color in the "*" portion of the css sheet, but found that it applied that color also the background of the
text elements, making the card striped with white. Placing the cream color background in the "body" portion of the css sheet fixed it. Small details. 


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools Buttons](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp) - This reference helped me add transitional colors to my buttons, giving them an extra little polish for fun.
- [Font Awesome Icons](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-icons-in-the-button-in-html/) - DID NOT EMPLOY THIS TECHNIQUE YET but I'd like to in the future!
